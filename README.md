### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The majority of the Kickstarter Campaigns that succeeded in meeting their goal where started in May with a secondary, smaller bump in October. This may be because May is the tail end of Spring and the beginning of summer; more people are likely to be out and about looking to go to entertainment. Another conclusion that may be drawn from the data is that seasonal workers who rely on good weather have more disposable income and are thus more inclined to back campaigns.
