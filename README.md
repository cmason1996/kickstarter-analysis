##An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
-This analysis breaks down the Kickstarter data set into multiple panes with varying information. First a series of pivot charts tallying Parent and Sub-Category success, failure, cancellation, and live categories. A conversion of UNIX time to Standard M/D/Y format for ease of access. Following this a visial represenation of the success and failure of Kickstarter campaigns in each month. Next the date of the successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns in the US of the Play subcategory are seperated from the larger dataset and a statistical analysis has been run on the contained data. Lastly is a box and whisker blot for the goal and pledge amounts for Kickstarter campaigns in Great Britain to search for and identify possible outliers

-From the analysis it can be determinded that that most successful campaigns are those that begin in May while the majority of campiagns are canceled in July and November with the majority of campaigns failing around the same time. From the statistical analysis of the play category campaigns in the US it can be determined that the most succesfull campaings are those that have goals in the median of the distribution of funding goals. On top of this, our standard deviation of the goal is more than double the IQR, telling us that there must be Kickstarter campaigns with very high goals that failed. Concerning the data from the musicals in Great Britain, the mean of the data set is appx. $4,000 while the median is appx. $2,000. This tells us that the majority of Kickstarter campaigns with funding goals near $2,000 were successful. The data also shows that 25% of the kickstarters in Great Britain failed to secure any pledges and were thus cancelled.

Recomendtions moving forward are to create your kickstarter campaign around February or May of the upcoming year, make the goal around between $5,000-$10,000, and create several different pledge options with a broad range of values as enticement for peoples of all types to donate. Recommendation for the Musical in Great Britain is to create the Kickstarter campaign around the same time of year with a goal amount of between $2,000-$4,000.
